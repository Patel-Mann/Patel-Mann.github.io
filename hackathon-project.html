      <h2>My Project: Fin-Track</h2>

      <p>
        Fin-Track was my solo project for CalgaryHacks 2025, built with the goal of
        rethinking how people connect with their finances in an increasingly digital world.
        While most finance apps live entirely in the cloud, I wanted to create something
        tangible an offline first personal finance system with a physical display that
        constantly reminds you of your spending, savings, and subscriptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project combined multiple features: an expense tracker, a subscription manager,
        and even small quiz modules designed to improve financial literacy. What made it
        unique was the hardware implementation. Using an ESP32 microcontroller with a
        liquid crystal display, I built a device that showed real time balances checking,
        savings, and spending so users always had a visible reminder of their financial
        situation. Much like a to-do list that stays in front of you until tasks are done,
        this display was meant to keep financial awareness constant, reducing the tendency
        to overspend.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the software side, I used Next.js and React for the frontend, with Supabase
        handling the database and authentication. The backend connected to banking data
        through the Plaid API, and Python/C code powered the hardware integration.
        Together, this created a seamless loop: financial data flowing from the cloud to
        the device, and back to the user in a way that felt real and immediate.

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Build the core first—get the system working, then polish later.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In a solo hackathon, there’s no time for perfection. I focused on the essentials:
        making sure the backend was stable, Plaid was integrated correctly, and the display
        worked reliably before adding features like quizzes or UI polish. This approach
        gave me a solid foundation and made it easier to iterate quickly without hitting
        major roadblocks close to the deadline.
      </p>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>

      <p>
        The biggest insight from Fin-Track is that sometimes technology should slow us
        down instead of speeding us up. By giving financial data a physical presence, I
        turned money from an abstract digital number into something people can’t ignore.
        Winning “Best Hardware Implementation” was a great validation, but more importantly,
        I left the hackathon with a stronger understanding of embedded systems, API
        integration, and how small design choices can have a big impact on user behavior.
