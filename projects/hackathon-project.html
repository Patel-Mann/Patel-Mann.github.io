          <h2>Project Overview</h2>

          <p>
            Fin-Track was my solo project for CalgaryHacks 2025, built with the goal of
            rethinking how people connect with their finances in an increasingly digital world.
            While most finance apps live entirely in the cloud, I wanted to create something
            tangible: an offline-first personal finance system with a physical display that
            constantly reminds you of your spending, savings, and subscriptions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project combined multiple features: an expense tracker, a subscription manager,
            and even small quiz modules designed to improve financial literacy. What made it
            unique was the hardware implementation. Using an ESP32 microcontroller with a
            liquid crystal display, I built a device that showed real-time balances for checking,
            savings, and spending so users always had a visible reminder of their financial
            situation. Much like a to-do list that stays in front of you until tasks are done,
            this display was meant to keep financial awareness constant, reducing the tendency
            to overspend.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the software side, I used Next.js and React for the frontend, with Supabase
            handling the database and authentication. The backend connected to banking data
            through the Plaid API, and Python/C code powered the hardware integration.
            Together, this created a seamless loop: financial data flowing from the cloud to
            the device, and back to the user in a way that felt real and immediate.

          <h3>Build the Core First — Get the System Working, Then Polish Later</h3>

          <p>
            In a solo hackathon, there's no time for perfection. I focused on the essentials:
            making sure the backend was stable, Plaid was integrated correctly, and the display
            worked reliably before adding features like quizzes or UI polish. This approach
            gave me a solid foundation and made it easier to iterate quickly without hitting
            major roadblocks close to the deadline.

          <h2>Takeaways</h2>

          <p>
            The biggest insight from Fin-Track is that sometimes technology should slow us
            down instead of speeding us up. By giving financial data a physical presence, I
            turned money from an abstract digital number into something people can't ignore.
            Winning "Best Hardware Implementation" was a great validation, but more importantly,
            I left the hackathon with a stronger understanding of embedded systems, API
            integration, and how small design choices can have a big impact on user behavior.
