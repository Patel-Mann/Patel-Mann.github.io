## Hackathons: Learning by Doing

Hackathons aren’t just about winning, they’re about learning quickly, building fast, and pushing your limits. For students especially, these events are a powerful way to test your knowledge in a real-world, time-boxed environment.

> The best approach? Focus less on the outcome and more on the experience. When you're genuinely enjoying what you're building, creativity flows and learning happens naturally.

Hackathons also offer valuable insight into where your skills stand and what technologies are in demand in today’s industry.



## My Project: ARTHA (Fin Track)

**Fin Track** is a personal finance tracker focused on reliability, local access, and user control. It’s designed to work independently of the cloud, with hardware-level integration and a custom user interface.

### Key Features

* **Always-On Local Tracker**
  Fin Track runs 24/7 on dedicated hardware, giving users full access to their data without cloud dependencies.

* **Secure Banking Integration**
  Uses Plaid’s API to pull real-time data from multiple bank accounts securely.

* **Visual Calendar View**
  Recurring payments and incomes are auto-organized into a calendar, helping users stay on top of their finances.

* **Custom Frontend**
  A lightweight, intuitive GUI displays essential financial data clearly and accessibly.



## What Made the Difference

> In solo hackathons, the key is to prioritize ruthlessly. Build the core functionality first. If there’s time, refine the user experience, but don’t start with polish.

I started by setting up the backend and hardware integration, making sure the app was fully functional before adding visuals or enhancements. This top-down strategy helped avoid time sinks and kept development focused.


## Advice for Future Hackers

* Start with a clear goal, but stay adaptable.
* Focus on what truly adds value to your project.
* Sleep a little. A fresh mind spots issues faster than a tired one.


Winning CalgaryHacks solo was an incredible experience but the real win was building something I believed in from the ground up. Whether you win or not, the skills, confidence, and momentum you gain from a hackathon stay with you far beyond the event.
