                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>As modern retail environments grow increasingly fast-paced, self-checkout systems have become essential for efficient customer service. This project—my self-checkout system developed in Java—was a personal endeavor to explore the power of multithreading and streamlined user interfaces. The system enabled multiple stations on a single CPU, reducing costs while maximizing efficiency.</p>
            
                <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Started in March 2023, this self-checkout system was designed to meet the needs of high-traffic environments without requiring costly hardware for each station. By leveraging Java and threading techniques, I created a setup that allows multiple video outputs and interactive stations, all controlled by a single CPU. This cost-effective solution provided an ideal framework for businesses seeking to enhance customer turnover with minimal hardware investment.</p>

                <h2 id="video">Project Demo</h2>
                <video controls width="100%">

                <h2 id="features">Key Features and Innovations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Station Support:</strong> Using threading, the system could operate multiple checkout stations concurrently on a single CPU, cutting operational costs by 50%. This setup supports high flexibility and scalability, making it adaptable to various retail environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simulated Barcode Scanning and Payment:</strong> Although real payment processing was not integrated, the system simulated scanning and checkout processes, providing a streamlined and intuitive user experience for testing and development purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Throughput:</strong> By optimizing the threading for high concurrency, the system increased throughput by 35%, allowing for faster customer turnover and handling of peak traffic periods more efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2 id="results">Results and Impact</h2>
                <p>This self-checkout system proved that efficient, multi-station setups could be achieved on a budget. By reducing hardware requirements and boosting processing throughput, the system highlights a practical solution for retailers looking to streamline their checkout processes without the high costs typically associated with multi-station setups. User feedback on the simulated experience was positive, noting the quick response and ease of use.</p>
            
                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This project was a fulfilling journey in creating an accessible and efficient self-checkout system using Java and threading. The lessons learned in multithreading and system optimization were invaluable, and I’m excited to apply these skills to future projects focused on scalability and user-centric design. Thank you for reading!</p>
