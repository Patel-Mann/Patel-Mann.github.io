                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>The field of autonomous driving is as fascinating as it is complex. To explore this domain, I embarked on a project to simulate a self-driving car in JavaScript. This project not only introduced me to JavaScript but also gave me hands-on experience with digital sensors and navigation algorithms. What began as a guided tutorial quickly evolved into a robust prototype, demonstrating fundamental concepts of autonomous navigation.</p>
            
                <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Starting in September 2023, this self-driving car simulation was developed as part of a university project. The objective was to build a basic autonomous vehicle model capable of navigating around obstacles in a controlled environment. By using JavaScript for the main simulation and sensor fusion techniques for enhanced obstacle detection, I created a model that achieved impressive responsiveness and accuracy.</p>

                <h2 id="features">Key Features and Innovations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Autonomous Navigation:</strong> Implemented digital sensors to enable basic autonomous navigation, reaching 90% obstacle detection accuracy. The sensors allowed the car to detect and react to obstacles, mimicking fundamental self-driving capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensor Fusion:</strong> Enhanced the simulation’s responsiveness by employing sensor fusion techniques, which reduced detection-to-avoidance delay by 25%. This improvement allowed the car to respond to obstacles more swiftly, emulating a realistic driving response.</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript and Learning Integration:</strong> Following a tutorial to build the foundation, I leveraged JavaScript for both learning and development, gaining insights into web-based simulations and interactive modeling.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2 id="results">Results and Impact</h2>
                <p>The self-driving car simulation achieved significant accuracy and responsiveness. With a 90% detection rate, the project served as a practical demonstration of how sensor-based navigation and JavaScript can be used to model autonomous behavior. The successful implementation of sensor fusion techniques highlights the simulation’s ability to handle obstacle detection and avoidance in a controlled setting.</p>
            
                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Building this self-driving car simulation was an exciting journey, blending software engineering principles with autonomous navigation concepts. Through this project, I strengthened my JavaScript skills while exploring the potential of sensor fusion in autonomous systems. This experience marks a valuable step in my learning, and I look forward to further exploring the possibilities in autonomous technology. Thank you for reading!</p>
